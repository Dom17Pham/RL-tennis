# Reinforcement Learning with Atari Tennis 
This project explores Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to train an agent through Reinforcement Learning (RL) to play Atari Tennis.

**The objective is to build and train an RL agent to play Atari Tennis proficiently and perform equivalent or above to human proficiency.**

The Jupyter notebook in this repo will go through building the DQN, training processes, and some cool results.
##
### Brief Overview
* Environment Setup: Using OpenAI Gym to simulate Atari Tennis.
* Neural Network Architecture: Designing a convolutional neural network to process game frames and predict Q-values
* Agent Design:  Implementing Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms to train our agent.
* Training Process: Using experience replay to stabilize training and improve performance.
* Testing Process: Evaluating the trained agent by running it through multiple games and assessing its gameplay.
* Results: Evaluating the agent's performance and metrics
